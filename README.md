# suggest an idea

suggest an idea is an application designed to allow users to propose suggestions for improvements and new features that help developers understand what their users are demanding.

TL;DR

As users, sometimes we want our opinions to be taken into account and we don't know where to leave our feedback and if it will be heard (twitter, reddit?, email to developers? reviews?).

With suggest an idea you can help to improve your favorite application and who knows, maybe you were not the only one who was thinking about that improvement or new functionality.

## ALL / IDEAS

- add search function
- add a function in admin panel to set that only registered users can vote and create ideas or that any user can use it.
- add the function to be able to comment on each idea
- add the function to be able to edit the idea and / or delete and that these are configurable from the admin panel.
- add sections with the apps and services to be able to comment under them

**Note:** This project is an open-source initiative aimed at fostering collaboration between users and developers. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements.
